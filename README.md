A GPS-Based Augmented Reality Game, Developed for my Msc Final Project at QMUL

The aim of the project was to enable a story-driven Augmented Reality game to be able to be played in any location around the world, through the use of a "Location Translation" algorithm, which takes set landmarks (e.g. park, supermarket, etc.) in one city, and translates them into equivalent landmarks in another, target city.

The game was designed in Unity for mobile devices running Android OS. This repository contains the C# scripts only.

The following video shows the app in action:  "https://www.wevideo.com/view/1193995046"
